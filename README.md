I wrote this code for the final project of my grade 10 computer science class when I was at ISY. This project spanned over 3 months worth of work and is still to this day one of my proudest coding experiences.
This is because
  1) It was my first long term code where I felt like I completed a full project rather than just a task
  2) Video Games are a big interest of mine and I actually had the freedom of choosing the game I wanted to design. I decided to plan a game that reminded me of one of my favorite childhood phone games and was able to fully put into visuals the idea that I had in mind.
  3) Sometimes, I still bring this code up to show it to my friends.

However, the code still has an issue: The high score was broken from the day of my submission and I tried fixing it at one point a few years later. Unfortunately I broke parts of the code without realizing it and without having a backup.
This explains why if you try running the game, you will see the score on the top left go up but then come back to 0 if you stop your car.
And this also explains why the time on the top left is not displayed correctly and shows an excessive count of digits.

I want to come back to this code at some point to fix it but it has been long since I finished it and I would have to sit down for a few hours to understand how everything was done and find the bugs in it.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy it and can share my video game passion by trying it out
